****Project 2****

**Overview**

For this project, I decided to make a simple set of maps depicting the change in vacant housing in Baltimore between 2000 and 2009. To do this, I used python to select the neighborhoods based off of how much they changed. This seperated them into those neighborhoods that increased the percentage of vacant lots, and those that diminished or maintained their levels of vacancy. This initial map, seperating only those two conditions, was strikingly similar to the "Black Butterfly" in Baltimore, where racial segregation had deligated racial minorities to live.

Next, I symbolized the varied increases and decreases in vacancy by putting them in color gradients, with white symbolizing little to no change in vacancy, while dark red and dark blue symbolize dramatic increases and decreases respectively.

Finally, I created 2 maps, one of 2000, and one of 2009, to quickly show the differences in vacancy that can be represented in a gif format below.

**Methods and Data**

To create this map, I utilized the 2000-2009 shapefiles, and manipulated the data such that it displayed the areas of the city most heavily affected by an increased number of vacant lots

The Python scripts used in this project are below.
